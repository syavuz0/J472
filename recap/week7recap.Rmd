## Loading the packages

Run the codeblock below to load the packages we will need for this recap

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(janitor)
```

## Load Data

Run the codeblock below to load the data.

```{r}
earthquakes <- read_csv('https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_month.csv')

#Setting time column as datetime
earthquakes <- earthquakes |> mutate(time = as_datetime(time))

earthquakes
```

#### Answer the questions below

Most questions have a code block and a space for an answer below. Write the code you think is necessary and, in the answer space, write out what you did and what was the result.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Q1** Do you notice anything different with this read_csv()? Particularly in the file name?

**A1: The file name that the program is trying to read is given in the form of a website address.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Q2** How many records there are there in this dataset? What do they mean and what useful information we can gather from it, looking at the columns?

**A2: There are 9,776 rows in the dataset describing the place, type, id, time, coordinates, depth and magnitude of earthquakes. In a short summary, they all give information about earthquakes.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Q3** How do I reorganize this list to see the ones that are the deepest first? What is the depth that shows up for the deepest one, and its magnitude?

```{r}
earthquakes |>
  group_by(id) |>
  summarise (depth, mag) |>
  arrange(desc(depth))

```

**A3: The deepest earthquake with the id of us7000kxdn had the highest depth at 669.9820 with a magnitude of 4.20**

**Q4** I just want to see the earthquakes with a magnitude larger than 6. How do I do that? And how many are there that fit this criteria?

```{r}

earthquakes |>
  group_by(type) |>
  filter(mag > 6) |>
    summarise(mag) |>
    arrange(desc(mag))

  

```

**A4: There are 12 earthquakes that have a magnitude of larger than 6.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Q5** What about if I want to see earthquakes that have both a magnitude larger than 6 and a depth smaller than 20? How many are there in the data set that fit [both]{.underline} these criteria?

```{r}
earthquakes |>
  group_by(type) |>
  filter(mag > 6 & depth < 20) |>
    summarise(mag, depth) |>
    arrange(desc(type))
```

**A5: There are 5 values that fit the criteria of a magnitude of greater than 6 and a depth of less than 20**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Q6** What about if I want to see earthquakes that either have a magnitude larger than 6 and a depth smaller than 20? How many are there in the data set that fit [either]{.underline} these criteria?

```{r}
earthquakes |>
  group_by(type) |>
  filter(mag > 6 | depth < 20) |>
    summarise(mag, depth) |>
    arrange(desc(type))


```

**A6: There are 7,413 rows that either have a depth of less than 20 or a magnitude of greater than 6.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Q7** I'm interested in finding earthquakes that took place in Alaska. Which column should I look at? How do I use it to find all the earthquakes in Alaska? How many earthquakes took place there?

```{r}
earthquakes |>
  filter(str_detect(place, "Alaska"))

```

**A7: 3,423 earthquakes took place in Alaska.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Q8** I notice that there is a column called 'type', that seems to have different kinds of tremors. What is the best way to find what are all the possible types of tremors, and counting how many of each there are in this data set? What are the first two most common types of tremors in this data set?

```{r}
earthquakes |> 
  group_by(type) |>
  summarise(count = n())

```

**A8: The first two most common types of tremors are earthquakes (9540 values) and quarry blasts (129 values).**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Q9** How do I calculate the average depth of each type of tremor? What is the average depth of the earthquake type in this data set? Is there anything that seems unusual or surprising in this finding?

```{r}

earthquakes |> 
  group_by(type) |>
  summarise(count = n(),
            avg_depth = mean(depth))
            
```

**A9: The average depth of an earthquake in this data set is 25.3. I find it surprising that it has the highest depth of all of the values, which are either negative numbers or zero.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Q10** I'm interested, in the future, to see the hours in which earthquakes happen. How can I extract the hour from the time column?

```{r}
earthquakes <- earthquakes |> mutate(hour = hour(time))
earthquakes
```

**A10: We mutate the extracted hour into a new column.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Q11** I want to make a note of all the records in this data set that I consider serious. For my purposes, I'm thinking that all tremors that have a magnitude that is larger than 3 are serious. How do I automatically create a new column making that distinction?

```{r}
earthquakes <- earthquakes |>
  mutate(serious = case_when(
    mag > 3 ~ 'Serious',
    .default = 'Not serious'
    ))
earthquakes
```

**A11: The mutate makes the new column and sorts them into serious and not serious based on if the magnitude value is greater than 3.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Q12** I have no idea how earthquakes work and I'm interested in seeing if there is a particular time of day in which serious earthquakes happen. How can I see that condensed in a table with all the hours in a day and all the serious earthquakes in each hour? What is the hour with fewer serious earthquakes and the one with the most serious earthquakes?

```{r}
earthquakes |> filter(serious == 'Serious' & type == 'earthquake')
  group_by(hour) |>
  summarise(count = n()) |>
  arrange(desc(count)) |>

```

**A12**: The data can change based on when it was
