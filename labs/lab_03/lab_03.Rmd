## Load libraries and establish settings

```{r}
# Turn off scientific notation
options(scipen=999)

# Load the tidyverse
library(tidyverse)
# Load janitor
library(janitor)
```

## Load data and clean up the column names

Load the two datasets we worked with in the pre_lab: the Maryland payments to vendors and Maryland grants and loans and, using janitor, change the columns so that they are lower-cased and any spaces are replaced with underscores.

```{r}
# Load in the Maryland state agency payments data, making sure that it correctly sets the datatypes using all of the rows
payments <- read_csv("data/State_of_Maryland_Payments_Data__FY2008_to_FY2024.csv", guess_max=373564) |> clean_names()

# Load in the Maryland grants and loan data 
md_grants_loans <- read_csv("data/State_of_Maryland_Grant_and_Loan_Data__FY2009_to_FY2022.csv") |> clean_names()
```

## Answer questions

Q1: You want to know how much money state agencies have paid to the Prince George's County School system, but to do that you'll need to find all of the variations of how the school system might be listed. Write code to find **rows where the vendor name contains the county's school system, starting with a broad search and then narrowing it down.** When you have found as many as possible, save the result to a **new dataframe** called `pg_schools`. How many records did you find?

A1: In the search that I did, there are 4,779 RECORDS.

```{r}
 pg_schools <- payments |>
    filter(str_detect(vendor_name, "PRINCE GEORGES COUNTY") | 
         str_detect(vendor_name, "SCHOOL") | 
         str_detect(vendor_name, "PGCPS") | 
         str_detect(vendor_name, "COUNTY SCHOOL"))
 pg_schools
```

Q2: Using that `pg_schools` dataframe, write code to calculate the total amount of payments to the Prince George's County School system for each fiscal year. Which fiscal year had the largest total amount? What do you notice about the years listed, and what questions do you have about that data?

A2: The fiscal year 2023 calculated a count of 648. What does that R00 mean and why is it the highest value?

```{r}
pg_schools |>
  group_by(fiscal_year, category) |> 
  summarise(count = n()) |>  
  arrange(desc(count))

```

Q3. You're interested in examining the vendors paid for **capital projects at** the University of Maryland. Search the payments data to find those payments, then write code to produce a **list of each vendor and the total amount it received**. Look carefully at that list - what cleaning will it require to ensure that you have only **one row per vendor and zip code**? Provide at least **three examples of vendor names that are similar and should be combined into one.** Describe how you might clean that data so that any nearly identical vendors would look identical - what would you change and how?

A3. The output is not giving me a result, but if I were to try and visualize what the program was doing, I would assume it needs cleaning in the category of zip codes. I'd make sure that each zip only has 5 valid values. I would also use cleaning to get rid of duplicates of one entry.

```{r}
capital_projects <- payments |>
  filter(str_detect(vendor_name, "CAPITAL PROJECTS") & str_detect(agency_name, "UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND")) |>
  group_by(vendor_name) |>
  summarise(amount)

capital_projects
```

Q4: You want to understand how much state grant money went to stem cell research projects each fiscal year. Search the data to find grants that fit that description. Once you find which columns contain the information you want, your code should standardize the data needed to find just the grants for stem cell research in a single filter. Then create a total amount of money for each fiscal year. Write a sentence summarizing how stem cell research funding has changed over time.

A4: For each fiscal year, the amount of funding for stem cell research projects increases between the years 2020 to 2022. The most amount of funding was received in 2020.

```{r}
md_grants_loans |>
  filter(str_detect(description, "STEM CELL") & str_detect(description, "RESEARCH")) |>
  group_by(description) |>
  arrange(desc(amount))


```
